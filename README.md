# Why are thermodynamic properties important?
Thermodynamic properties are important because they help us understand how energy is transferred and transformed in different processes. These properties, like enthalpy, entropy, and internal energy, show how much energy is used or released during chemical reactions or physical changes. They also help us predict if a reaction will happen on its own or if it will stop at a certain point. Engineers use this knowledge to design systems that save energy and work efficiently, like power plants or cooling systems. In research, properties like free energy and pressure help scientists understand how molecules interact, which is important for improving technologies such as water treatment and material development. In short, thermodynamic properties are essential for creating efficient, safe, and sustainable solutions in many areas of science and engineering.  

### Boyle temperature  
The temperature at which the second virial coefficient becomes zero is called the Boyle temperature. Although this unique temperature can be experimentally measured (by PVT measurements, static light scattering and other experimental methods), this determination encounters different challenges because of the common high value of the Boyle temperature. The Boyle temperature can be also estimated using Zeno line. A plot of temperature - density diagram can move us toward the regularity displayed by different fluids along the contour of the unit compressibility factor (Z = 1). Along this unit compressibility contour, termed Zeno line or Zeno contour, the density of many fluids shows a linear trend, while the Boyle temperature can be estimated from extrapolation of the Zeno line to zero density (ρ → 0).
