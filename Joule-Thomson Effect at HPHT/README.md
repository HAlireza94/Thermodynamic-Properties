In this research, Joule–Thomson coefficients for pure, binary, ternary, and multicomponent systems are 
predicted using translated and consistent versions of Peng-Robinson and Redlich-Kwong equations of state. 
The former is claimed to be certainly the most accurate and the safest three-parameter cubic equation of state ever published.
The obtained results are compared with the predictions provided by Peng-Robinson, Soave-Redlich-Kwong, Volume Translated Peng-Robinson,
Volume Translated Soave-Redlich-Kwong, and Patel-Teja-Valderrama equations of state along with different alpha functions, including Peng – Robinson original form (1976),
Coquelet et al. (2004), Haghtalab et al. (2011), Saffari – Zahedi (2013), Soave – Redlich – Kwong original form (1972), Ozokwelu – Erbar (1987), Trebble – Bishnoi (1987), 
Nasrifar – Bolland (2004), and Pina – Martinez et al. (2019). Furthermore, the obtained results are compared to the available experimental data. 
Moreover, the performance of translated-consistent Peng-Robinson and translated-consistent Redlich-Kwong equations of state is determined at low pressures (60 atm)
up to high pressures (360 atm) in comparison to the other equations of state.
The dependency of the Joule – Thomson coefficient as a function of the mole fraction has been investigated.
To compare better, Joule–Thomson inversion curves are also depicted for a variety of systems, containing pure, binary, ternary, and multicomponent mixtures.
All codes are written in MATLAB.
